# Amazon clone

Building in a one (maybe two) day sprint do not have time to implament anywhere near close to everything, basically going for an amazon themed basic e-store that will allow users to authenticate, search items,  add items to cart, remove from cart, and checkout.

# Journal

0.1.X = header
0.2.X = home page

# Future releases (maybe)

- Scale everything for mobile viewing
- Add stripe for payemnt processing (basic trial tier to give the site the feels)
- Add internal functions so that user can see thier stores progress and list items for sale, remove thier items have complete admin controls.
